  <p class="body">Robert Laganière is a professor at the School of Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Ottawa. He is
also a Faculty member of the VIVA research lab and is the co-author of
several scientific publications and patents in content-based video
analysis, visual surveillance, driver-assistance, object detection and
tracking. Robert authored the OpenCV Computer Vision Application
Programming Cookbook (Packt pub. 3rd ed. 2017) and co-authored Object
Oriented Software Development (McGraw Hill 2001). He co-founded Visual
Cortek in 2006, an Ottawa-based video analytics startup that was later
acquired in 2009 by iWatchLife.com, a cloud-based video monitoring
company. He is also a consultant in computer vision and has been Chief
Scientist in a number of startups companies such as Cognivue Corp, an
embedded vision semiconductors company acquired by NXP in 2016. In
2016, Robert founded Tempo Analytics, a startup company proposing
retail analytics solutions. Robert has a Bachelor of Electrical
Engineering degree from Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal (1987) and
M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from INRS-Telecommunications, Montreal (1996).</p>

  <p class="body">Dr. Dalila B. Megherbi received the Sc.M in Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Sc.M in Applied Mathematics, and the Ph.D in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.  Dr. Megherbi is a faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. She is the founder and Director of the research Center for Computer Machine/Human Intelligence Networking and Distributed Systems (CMINDS). Her research is internationally recognized. Since joining UMass Lowell, Dr. Megherbi holds more than 110 refereed peer-reviewed publication articles, including in the IEEE and the prestigious Nature Biotechnology (impact factor 41.667). She holds US patent. At UMass Lowell, she has been the recipient of numerous research grants and contracts, as the primary lead principal investigator, from several federal agencies and the industry, including, DoD AFRL/WPAB, NSF, US FDA, NIH, Raytheon Air Missile Defense Systems, Xilinx Inc., Structural Dynamics Research Corporation, SUN Microsystems, Altera Inc., and Sky Computers Inc. She graduated more than 30 graduate students Ph.D. and MS students with a thesis option. She serves as associate editor and member of the editorial boards and reviewer for a dozen of journals, including IEEE transactions. She has been invited to organize/TPC/session chair, and to speak at several national and international conferences. She has been invited to serve on national and international peer review boards including, NSF, NIH, NASA, and National Science Foundation of Ireland. She has been the recipient of several research and teaching awards, including the recipient of the Best Paper Award of all conference tracks at the IEEE International Conference on Homeland Security, the recipient of the IEEE Control Systems Society CDC Best Paper Finalist Award, the recipient of the Best Paper Award at the IEEE international conference ROMA, the recipient of the Top Professor Award for Outstanding Academic Integrity Leadership and Service to the students, the recipient of several university of Massachusetts Lowell Outstanding Teaching Excellence Awards, the recipient, each year since this recognition award was initiated in 2010, of 6 UMass Lowell Annual Research and Scholarship Recognition Awards, in recognition of faculty with extensive scholarship during that year. She has been a member of an international project consortium led by the US FDA. She was invited, interviewed and quoted in the New York Times for her expertise in big data facial recognition for homeland security applications. She was contacted by major national and international news agencies for her work and expertise in big data and facial recognition for homeland security. She was invited, interviewed and featured by the Science News Radio Network for her expertise in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data technologies applied to Weapons of Mass Destruction. Her primary current research interests are in computational machine vision and intelligence, deep learning, “Big data” analytics, knowledge extraction/representation, and adaptive learning systems in distributed computing systems and networks, with applications to homeland security and the life sciences (high throughput meta-genomics). Her main research goal is the understanding of and building sensor-based machines that can be made to exhibit intelligence. The idea is to build intelligent machines/sensors and to understand certain aspects of human and animal biological intelligence.</p>
